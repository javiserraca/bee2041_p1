# Has The European Union Done A Good Job At Managing The Covid-19 Pandemic?
The following data-driven blog post is written using a Covid-19 dataset compiled from a multitude of credible sources by the "Our World in Data" organisation. For more information on the data used in this blog post visit:https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-codebook.csv.

Over the past sixteen months, the whole world has been struggling in a seemingly endless battle against the Covid-19 virus. The virus, first discovered in the city of Wu Han, China, quickly spread to the rest of the world, catching many countries who were underprepared completely off guard. Some of the most notable of these countries being the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and members of the European Union. This blog post will analyse data from member countries of the European Union and conclude whether the EU did a satisfactory job at dealing with the pandemic.

The EU is an entity with 27 member countries that combined hold the majority of the land in the European continent. As such, because of the considerable differences between member countries, it is logical for there to be great discrepancies in the enacted economic and political policies.

As a quick example of how different countries within the EU are and how differently have dealt with the pandemic, we can compare Sweden's refusal to implement any lockdown whatsoever with Denmark's two different national lockdowns (totalling 99 days in total lockdown). 

The diagram seen underneath is a representation of how the Covid-19 pandemic has evolved in each of the 27 EU-member countries over time, showing the number of daily new Covid-19 cases officially recorded since March 14th 2020 up until March 23rd 2021. As a general trend in the data, we can see how there was a sharp peak in the number of Covid-19 cases early in the pandemic for all countries, followed by a brief decrease for most countries (specifically those that implemented strict relevant lockdowns). On the other hand, we can also see that shortly after this point, daily Covid-19 cases started to rise once again, and even though many countries (including the likes of Denmark or France) implemented new lockdowns which likely helped flatten the curve and provide stability, the general trend in the data never descends back down.

Admittedly, having the data of 27 separate sovereign countries on one diagram is not visually appealing or informative. As such, the following diagrams divide the data already shown above into more logical comparisons between countries based on their geographical locations. In this way, it becomes much easier to compare the data from different countries within the EU, being able to to compare data within geographical locations as well as across geographical locations (as the axes are the identical for all seven plots).

For example, it becomes quite clear that while Western European countries like Ireland or the Netherlands were successful at preventing the spread of Covid-19, countries like Sweden, Bulgaria, or Romania have had what looks like relatively constant and continuous Covid-19 infections throughout the pandemic.

While the diagrams above use a logarithmic y-axis to help make potential trends more evident, keeping the y-axis increasing at a constant rate helps put into perspective the variance between what is essentially three different periods in the pandemic: the first wave, represented by the first peak seen in the data for every country; the recovery period, during which most countries were able to dramatically decrease the extent to which the virus had spread; the second wave, the substantial increase in cases occurring at slightly different periods depending on the country but inevitably affecting all of them. The distinction between these periods can clearly be observed in the following group of diagrams.

The following seven diagrams are, therefore, representing the same data that was previously observed except for plotting it on a y-axis increasing at a constant rate.

Based on the data shown above, we can conclude that countries in the European Union were clearly underprepared for the possibility of an international pandemic. The first wave, clearly pictured in the seven diagrams seen above, devastated every country, overwhelming healthcare systems, and generating widespread uncertainty and fear (the exact ingredients that lead to many crises over history).

Countries across the EU were forced into taking severe decisions (including the implementation of lockdowns, curfews, and quarantines) that would cause shattering short-run economic instability in the region and create a perilous political climate in which such decisions simply could not be maintained. This led to the second wave most countries are still dealing with in the present. 

Even though these diagrams have been able to give us an appropriate level of information on the general trend of the pandemic that has taken place in the EU, they themselves cannot conclude whether the EU and its members have dealt with the pandemic correctly or not. To be able to reach such a conclusion it is necessary to compare EU-member countries with non-EU-member countries and see the differences in the data, if any exist.

The diagram below is a visualization comparing Covid-19 data from Germany and Italy, both major EU countries, with Vietnam and Taiwan, both non-EU-member countries.

Although all four countries had significant Covid-19 cases during the start of the pandemic, the governments in Taiwan and Vietnam were able to quickly control the spreading of the virus, successfully preventing further infections. On the other hand, the data from the diagram also shows that the minimum recorded new cases in one day in Germany or Italy at any point in the pandemic is still greater than the maximum cases recorded in one day in either Vietnam or Taiwan. As such, it is rational to come to the conclusion that both Vietnam and Taiwan have been able to curb the spread of the virus much more effectively than any single EU-member, even though they are geographically much further away from the origin of the virus.

The diagram above compared Germany and Italy, two of the EU's highly developed countries, with another highly developed and industrialised country (Taiwan) and a developing country (Vietnam) located in a completely different geographical location as a means to objectively show how both economically weaker and equivalent countries dealt with the pandemic more adeptly.

Further proof of this can be seen in the diagrams below, where the clear differences can be seen in the number of Covid-19-caused deaths. Although Taiwan and Vietnam are made up of much less area than Germany or Italy, according to the "Worldometer" organisation, they both have higher population densities and more tropical climates, contributing to a more suitable environment for Covid-19 to spread than that of Europe. In fact, the population density of Taiwan is almost three times that of Germany, however, as the bar plot underneath shows, Germany has over 8,000 times the number of people that have died from Covid-19.

While economies can eventually recover from devastating exogenous shocks to the economy, irreversible cultural, individual, emotional, emotional, and economic losses due to the people that passed away from Covid-19 will take significantly lengthier time to overcome.

Subsequently, after analysing the data shown above in a multitude of different diagrams and plots, it becomes compelling to come to the conclusion that EU-member countries have undoubtedly underperformed at contending with pandemic when compared with other countries in the world. This can be due to several factors, including the significant political and cultural ties that exist between member countries, limiting their ability to isolate themselves away and take drastic measures. However, it is also important to mention that while EU-member countries are part of a larger entity, that entity did not dictate what policies they should or should not take when coping with the spread of the virus. 

While the European Union itself has not been able to deal with the threat that is Covid-19 as effectively as countries like Vietnam, Taiwan, or New Zealand for example, it is important to indicate that such a lack of success at handling the spread of the virus is due to the lack of action and lack of preparation from individual members rather than the entity as a whole.
